# React-Redux setup

This is a simple yet powerful React-Redux boilerplate for later use as a starting point in other projects. It derives from `create-react-app` with a few modifications, which include installing StyleLint, ESLint, and Bootstrap, removing unimportant files, and adding some content to the remaining files. It features a functional Counter component that implements Redux for state management, using `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks.

## Getting Started

To get React and Redux up and running in another project, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository into your machine (Or download the .zip file and extract).
2. Open the project's folder.
3. Copy and paste all files and folders except app_screenshot.png, app_screenshot-2.png, MIT.md, and README.md into the other project's root folder.
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm start`

### Considerations

- Intended only for use as a starting point in other projects. Do not copy and paste these files into more mature projects as this will overwrite your package.json and package-lock.json files.
- This project also includes Bootstrap for styling.

### Setup

Follow the steps described before.
